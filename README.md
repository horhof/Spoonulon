![Example screenshot](doc/screenshot.png)

Spoonulon is a program for generating Spoonerisms from two words.

> A spoonerism is an error in speech in which corresponding consonants, vowels, or morphemes are switched between two words in a phrase, such as saying "The Lord is a shoving leopard" instead of "The Lord is a loving shepherd."
>
> These are named after the Oxford don and ordained minister William Archibald Spooner, who was famous for doing this.
